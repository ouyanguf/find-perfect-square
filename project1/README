1. Size of the work unit that results in best performance

For "scala project1 1000000 4", the following table shows the relation
between WORKUNIT, CPU TIME(SYS TIME + USER TIME) / REAL TIME and REAL TIME.

WORKUNIT      CPU TIME/REAL TIME       REAL TIME
-------------------------------------------------
10			  1.850					   14.600s
50			  1.819						8.295s
100			  1.799					    7.096s
500			  1.566						2.633s
1000		  1.521						2.222s
5000		  1.266						1.456s
10000		  1.300						1.330s
50000		  1.245						1.295s
100000		  1.235						1.273s
500000		  1.262						1.255s
1000000		  1.134						1.362s

For best REAL TIME, the WORKUNIT is expected to be 500000.

For best CPU TIME/REAL TIME ratio, the WORKUNIT is expected to be 10 or less.

2. The result of running "scala project1 1000000 4"

$ scala project1 1000000 4
Perfect Square Not Found!

3. The running time for "scala project1 1000000 4"

$ time scala project1 1000000 4
Perfect Square Not Found!

real   0m2.624s
user   0m3.840s
sys    0m0.324s

(user time + sys time) / real time = 1.59

4. The largest problem

(1) The largest problem(number) my computer managed to solve is 1000000000 as shown below.

$ time scala project1 1000000000 4
Perfect Square Not Found!

real 1m38.562s
user 3m14.916s
sys  0m0.216s

(2) The largest problem I managed to solve

For the basic part of the project, I have the problem that the running time is much longer than others'.
Then I found that my program have divided the job to work unit of 1 and just throw them all to the router.
In the case, one actor may get many work units to work. And this may have some overhead that one actor may
receive and reply many times.

Then I modified the program.I set the work unit by divide all sub-problems by number of workers so that every
worker would have only one task to work. But the task may be a little bigger. In this way, the running time
decreased.
