We solved the problem with 1 server machine(Super Boss) and 8 remote machines(Boss and Workers).

We use 'lin114-10.cise.ufl.edu' as the SERVER(Super Boss).

The REMOTE CLIENTS(Boss and Workers) we used are as follows.
'lin114-01.cise.ufl.edu'  'lin114-02.cise.ufl.edu'
'lin114-03.cise.ufl.edu'  'lin114-04.cise.ufl.edu'
'lin114-06.cise.ufl.edu'  'lin114-07.cise.ufl.edu'  
'lin114-08.cise.ufl.edu'  'lin114-09.cise.ufl.edu'

Our programs run based on scala sbt.
8 file folders for clients and 1 file folders for Server must exactly match the machine that run them.
Because the .conf file need to change when it is on different machines.

Follow these steps to run our program:
(1) For all 'lin114-(01,02,03,04,06,07,08,09).cise.ufl.edu' Terminals:
    "cd" into the client folder that matches its name
    run "sbt run"
    choose the number that matches "RemoteBossApp"
(2) On 'lin114-10.cise.ufl.edu' Terminal:
    "cd" into the server folder
    run "sbt run"
    choose the number that matches "ServerApp"

Then the clients will display the result(s) only for the part they work on.
The server will display all results for the whole task.

In this remote mode, N can be as large as possible until it reaches the maximum Long value allowed by the scala runtime.
Below are some of the largest experiments results:

N                K         Running Time
-------------------------------------------------------------
2,000,000,000    4         12.12sec
1,000,000,000    4          5.31sec

This is about 4 times faster than the single machine version.

For required N(100000000) and K(20), there is no result and the running time is 3.86sec.

This is the end. Thanks.
